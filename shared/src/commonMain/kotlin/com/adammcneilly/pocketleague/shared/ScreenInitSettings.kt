/* INITALIZATION BEHAVIOUR (two UI recompositions):
when a screen is first navigated to, using "dkmpNav.navigate(screen,params)", this is what happens in sequence:
1. The screen state is initialized with the value defined in "initState" (typically it includes "isLoading=true"), so that the UI can show a "loading..." message
2. The FIRST recomposition is triggered, so that the UI layer displays the "initState"
3. After recomposition, the function defined in "callOnInit" is called, which typically loads the data from the Repository
4. The "callOnInit" function typically makes a call to "stateManager.updateScreen()", which updates the state and hence triggers the SECOND recomposition */
